# SEafloor Annotation and Mapping Support (SEAMS) App

The SEAMS App, is a powerful tool designed for the interpretation of seafloor images and video. Developed for the Sveriges Geologiska Undersokning (SGU) this application streamlines the annotation and mapping process of underwater data using the visuel methods.

With the SEAMS App, users can easily analyze and annotate seafloor imagery and video, enabling efficient and accurate interpretation for geological studies, marine research, and various underwater mapping applications. It offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the workflow, allowing users to mark, classify, and estimate the abundance of seafloor epibenthos and substrates.

Whether you are a geologist, marine scientist, or environmental researcher, the SEAMS App provides a comprehensive platform to support your seafloor interpretation needs. Enjoy the streamlined workflow and harness the power of cutting-edge technology to unlock valuable insights from underwater imagery and video.
